Filter out text content from your posts which could include offensive, vulger or controversial text. Or Replace  those text from your posts which could be a product name upon its name change.

1. Find the Text Filtering Options in your settings > Text Filtering.
2. You can add as many filters as you want and then remove when you no longer need them to be applied to your posts.
